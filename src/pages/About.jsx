                At PrepPal, we believe that the best learning happens when
                students collaborate and support each other. Our platform was
                born out of the need to bridge the gap in exam preparation at
                LNMIIT. We understand that the journey through academia can be
                challenging, especially when trying to grasp complex topics and
                lectures.
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>
                That’s why we created PrepPal – a dedicated space where LNMIIT
                students can share their knowledge and insights through video
                tutorials. Whether you're struggling with a specific topic or
                seeking alternative explanations, our community-driven platform
                offers a wealth of resources at your fingertips.
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>
                Our goal is simple: to empower every student with the tools and
                support they need to excel. By enabling students to upload and
                access lecture videos, PrepPal transforms peer learning into a
                powerful, accessible, and interactive experience.

                Join us in building a collaborative learning environment where

              <p className="text-base font-medium text-richblack-300 lg:w-[95%]">
                Our journey began with a simple yet profound mission: to enhance
                exam preparation and academic support for students at LNMIIT. As
                we navigated the demands and pressures of exam times, we
                recognized a common challenge among our peers— the need for
                accessible, peer-driven educational resources. In response, we
                envisioned a platform designed specifically for our university
                community. We wanted to create a space where students could
                share their insights and knowledge through video content,
                helping one another understand complex topics and excel in their
                studies.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base font-medium text-richblack-300 lg:w-[95%]">
                Our platform allows any LNMIIT student to upload videos
                explaining various lectures and topics, creating a rich
                repository of resources tailored to our unique curriculum. By
                fostering collaboration and peer-to-peer teaching, we aim to
                support each student's learning journey and make exam
                preparation more effective and engaging. Our mission is to
                bridge the gap between individual learning needs and the
                collective knowledge within our university, empowering every
                student to succeed and thrive.
